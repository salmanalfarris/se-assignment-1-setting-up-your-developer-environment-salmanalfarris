# Dev_Setup
Setup Development Environment

#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

#Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

#Tasks:

1. Select Your Operating System (OS):
   Choose an operating system that best suits your preferences and project requirements. Download and Install Windows 11. https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11

step 1: create installation media for fresh install.
step 2: select edition that is windows 11 that is licensed for the system and architecture that is 64 bit.

step 3: installation, restart the computer and select install know.
step 4: activation, once installed windows will automatically activate.

step 5: partition that is select the custom option to ensure clean install and not upgrade install.

step 6: check activation that is after fresh install, windows 11 automatically activate then click the update and security button and go to the activation tab.

In conclusion, the callenges faced during installation of windows 11 is that if custom option is not selected there will be no clean install instead there will be ugrade install which would have long term negative impact on the windows operating system.

2. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):

The recommended text editor for my projects is notepad because it offers the most basic text manipulation function such as finding and replacing text.

   Select and install a text editor or IDE suitable for your programming languages and workflow. Download and Install Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/Download

step 1: download visual studio, visit the website and click download visual studio.
step 2: follow the on-screen instruction to download the installer.
step 3: run the downloaded installer, choose the visual studio workload during installation.
step 4: select workload and component, in the visual studio installer select the workloads and component.
step 5: modify installation, customize the installation by clicking on the individual component tab.
step 6: install, click the install button to start the installation process.
step 7: launch visual studio, once installation is complete launch visual studio.
step 8: choose development environment, on the welcome screen select you development environment.
step 9: start coding that is create new project or open existing one to begin your development work.

3. Set Up Version Control System:
   Install Git and configure it on your local machine. Create a GitHub account for hosting your repositories. Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit. https://github.com

step 1: navigate to the official git download page and download the latest version of 64-bit.
![alt text](image-6.png)
step 2: double-click the downloaded file to extract and launch the installer.
step 3: review the general public license and when ready install, click next.
step 4: the installer prompt you for an installation location and click next.
step 5: in the component selection screen, leave the default unless you need to change them and click next.
step 6: the installer offers to create a start menu folder, click next and accept and proceed to the next step.
step 7: select text editor you want to use with git i.e note++.
step 8: the next step allow you to choose a different name for your initial branch, select let git decide and click next.
step 9: this step allow you to change the PATH environment, the path is the default set of the directories included when you run a command,keep middle that is git from the command line and also from third pary and click next.
step 10: the installer prompt you to select the SSH client for Git to use and click next.
step 11. this step relates to server certificate and recommended option is use openSSL library.
step 12: click checkout windows-style,commit Unix-style line ending.
step 13: use minTTY the default terminal.
step 14: allows you to git pull that is first forward or merge.
step 15: select git credential manager.
step 16: enable file system caching.
step 17: install and finish.
after installing you can open gitbash and perform the command you intend.

for github;
step 1: go to the website.
step 2: type user name, email address and a password.
step 3: sign up for github and follow instruction.
this account will enable the holder to fork assignment and clone to the gitbash and submit the link to any external website.
Most of the challenges arise when one use several github account simulteniously in this case its not adviceble to use passcode.

4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.

step 1: select python version to download.
step 2: click on the install know, latest version being python 3.8.6 64-bit.
step 3: installation process complete.
python can use vs code to execute mini projects.

5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).

adding pip to path in python involves; openining environment variable,clicking environment variables, double clicking the path to edit,select new and add directory to the path where pip is installed and click ok to save changes, run pip help and configure.

6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html

go the official wensite,select the two option available select MySQl community server.
step 1: after downloading the setup, unzip it anywhere and double click the MSI insaller .exe file.
step 2: choose the set up type as full.
step 3: click execute to install all requirement automatically.
step 4: on the next wizard,click next.
step 5: after execute button, it will download and install all the product.
step 6: congigure the MySQL server and router.
step 7: chooseMySQL server/Classic MySQL replication option and click on next.
step 8: click config type as development machine.
step 9: select authentication methodand click next.
step 10: set the mention MySQL Root password.
configure the window service,execute,finish,product configuration,router configuration,connect to the server using the set password,select the applied configuration and click finish button and MySQL installation is complete.

7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.

   -it involves efficient coding, testing and debugging.

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.

9. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process. 

    -installing the neccessary software,tools and framework.
    -configuring system setting.
    -organizing project file and dependancies.

#Deliverables:
- Document detailing the setup process with step-by-step instructions and screenshots where necessary.
- A GitHub repository containing a sample project initialized with Git and any necessary configuration files (e.g., .gitignore).
- A reflection on the challenges faced during setup and strategies employed to overcome them.

#Submission:
Submit your document and GitHub repository link through the designated platform or email to the instructor by the specified deadline.

#Evaluation Criteria:**
- Completeness and accuracy of setup documentation.
- Effectiveness of version control implementation.
- Appropriateness of tools selected for the project requirements.
- Clarity of reflection on challenges and solutions encountered.
- Adherence to submission guidelines and deadlines.
